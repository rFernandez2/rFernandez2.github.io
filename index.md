## Hi, I'm roberto!

I am a software engineer based in San Francisco and am currently working @stripe on the Insight team.

I am currently interested/learning about ML applications in bioinformatics and the Rust programming language.

Outside of CS I enjoy reading (sociology, economics, fiction) and playing the piano and guitar.

I also [write](http://rfernandez2.github.io/blog/) about the maths I am learning from time to time.
