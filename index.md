## Hi, I'm roberto!

I am a software engineer based in San Francisco and am currently working @stripe on the Insight team.

I am interested in the intersection of algebra, fourier analysis, and ML as well as distributed data systems and adaptive and self-managing systems.

I am also spending quite a bit of my time running, cooking, and learning the piano.

I also [write](http://rfernandez2.github.io/blog/) about maths from time to time.
