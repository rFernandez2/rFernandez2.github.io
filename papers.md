Some papers (essentially longer blog posts) I've written either for school or to explore some problem of interest:

- [Azuma-Hoeffding Inequality](https://www.dropbox.com/s/235ejimncbbgl3f/final_paper.pdf?dl=0) - Exploring how Martingales and their concentration bounds can be applied to combinatorics and counting problems.

- [BigDL](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9lk9vfx3o1tbes5/bigdl_writeup.pdf?dl=0) - Benchmarking Intel's CPU-based DL library vs. GPU-accelerated TensorFlow.

- [Machine Learning and Cancer](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0rwjiy8k5onyod4/Final%20Paper.pdf?dl=0) - Non-technical discussion of potential future applications of ML to cancer research.
